# EarthquakeProj

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.
insert description here. 

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/[INSERT LINK HERE]
cd earthquake-proj
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts



These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
* `npm run ci` - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
